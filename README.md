# Angular Tour Of Heroes
 
 - I created the project : ng new angular-tour-of-heroes
 - cd angular-tour-of-heroes
 - ng serve --open

 # Create component
 - ng generate component heroes

 # Create a Hero interface
  URL way : src/app/hero.ts

  # Create mock heroes
URL way : src/app/mock-heroes.ts

- The *ngFor is Angular's repeater directive. It repeats the host element for each element in a list.
- Don't forget the asterisk (*) in front of ngFor. It's a critical part of the syntax.
- Target event : <button (click)="onSave($event)">Save</button>
